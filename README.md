This is an assignment from The Odin Project's section on intermediate HTML and CSS.  The main goal of this assignment is to use CSS grid and flexbox in harmony to organize quite a few different elements on one page.  

This assignment also allows a good opportunity to practice developing one's individual style while applying it to a common practical purpose.
